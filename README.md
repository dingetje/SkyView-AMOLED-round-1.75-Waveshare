# SkyView Traffic Awareness Device

SkyView is a traffic awareness device designed to display air traffic received through EC radio devices, such as **SoftRF SenseCap Card**, and visualize **FLARM NMEA** or **Garmin GDL90** data on its screen.

### Key Features:
- This code is a fork to support [round Waveshare 1.75 AMOLED Display](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-1.75)

- Best suited as a companion device for **SoftRF hardware**, providing user-friendly visualization of nearby traffic.
- Proven compatibility with **SkyEcho**, **Stratux**, **PilotAware** and **PowerMouse** devices, as reported by builders.

### Waveshare board shenanigans
- the Waveshare board offers two buttons. One labeled BOOT, the other PWR.
- The PWR button can be used to power off the device with a long press > 3 sec, and **very long** press (~7 sec.) to power back on.
- The SLEEP button on the **Settings** page of the touch screen can also be used to power the device off.
- The board will also power on when:
  - A battery is inserted
  - A powered USB cable is inserted
- The BOOT button acts as a MODE switch to step through the SkyView screens in a circular method:
  
   **Radar Screen** ➡️ **Traffic Info Screen** ➡️ **Compass Screen** (if enabled)
- sometimes the board is not recognized by Windows when the USB-C cable is connected. In that case press both PWR and BOOT simulataneously and then release BOOT button. This should result in a COM port again (check Windows Device Manager).

### Supported Data Input Methods:
- **Classic Serial Interface**
- **Wi-Fi UDP Connection**
- **Bluetooth LE**
- **Legacy Bluetooth SPP is NOT possible**

### Enhanced Functionality:
This is a forked repository of SkyView:
- **Supported in PlatformIO**: A versatile tool for building and compiling firmware for various devices and screens.
- **Supports AMOLED Colour Displays**: Optimized for vibrant and high-resolution visualizations.
- **Swipe Page Navigation**: Switching between pages is done effortlessly by swiping **left-right** or **up-down**.
- **Voice Output**: traffic advisory, plus danger alert, requires voice data on SD card.
