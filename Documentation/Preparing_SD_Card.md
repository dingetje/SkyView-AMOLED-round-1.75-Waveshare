# Preparing SD card

The waveshare board supports an SD card that can be used for both the OGN database and Voice data.

1. In the **binaries/SDCard** folder you can download the [SD.zip](../binaries/SDCard/SD.zip) archive (make sure to **Download raw file**).
2. unzip this archive in the root of a FAT32 formatted SD card [^1].

> [!WARNING]
> Make sure not to format the SD card with **exFAT** format, this is not supported on the Waveshare board!

4. This should result in a directory structure in the root of the SD card, similar to this:

## Using the OGN db
- Make sure in the SkyView settings via [http://192.168.1.1](http://192.168.1.1) to set **Aircraft data** to **Glidernet (OGN)**

2. Make sure to have the SD card mounted with the **Voice** files.
3. in the SkyView settings via [http://192.168.1.1](http://192.168.1.1) enable one of the voice options at **Voice**

## Updating the OGN db
To update the OGN db follow these steps:
1. Download most recent .CDB file that contains OGN Aircrafts Data from [this location](http://soaringweather.no-ip.info/ADB/data/ogn.cdb)
2. Eject the SD card from your Waveshareboard and mount in on your PC using a suitable SD card reader
3. Copy the downloaded ogn.cdb in the **Arcrafts** folder, overwriting the existing file
4. Safe eject the SD card
5. Place the SD card back in the Waveshare board
6. Verify on the status page at [http://192.168.1.1](http://192.168.1.1) that the OGN records show a non-zero value
