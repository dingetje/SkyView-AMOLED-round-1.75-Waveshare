This photo shows SkyView connected to a BLE device, waiting for GPS Fix:

The BLE battery level is visible if the BLE device (in this case a SoftRF T-Beam) supports reporting battery level.

During the NO DATA and NO FIX phase, the SkyView display will fade in/fade out to reduce battery usage and to indicate it's not ready for normal operation.
As soon as valid GPS data comes in, the device will switch to **Radar View**.
